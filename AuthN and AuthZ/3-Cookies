THIRD PARTY COOKIE: Understand it by an example - 

When Alice does her shopping at jeans.example.com, the jeans.example.com origin server uses a session cookie to remember that she has logged into her account. This is an example of a first-party cookie. However, Alice may not be aware that a cookie from example.ad-network.com is also stored in her browser and is tracking her activity on jeans.example.com, even though she is not currently accessing example.ad-network.com.
