PORT:

(1) A port is a virtual point where network connections start and end.
(2) Ports are software-based and managed by a computer's operating system.
(3) Ports allow computers to easily differentiate between different kinds of traffic or services. For example,

emails go to a different port than webpages, even though both reach a computer over the same Internet connection.


PORT NUMBER:

(1) Ports are standardized across all network-connected devices, with each port assigned a number.
(2) Most ports are reserved for certain protocols â€” for example, HTTP messages go to port 80, HTTPS goes to 443.
